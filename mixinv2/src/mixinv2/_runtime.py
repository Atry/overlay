Mixin and Scope implementation for proper is_public and is_eager support.

This module provides a cleaner architecture with:
- Single lazy evaluation level (at Mixin.evaluated only)
- Frozen Scope containers
- Proper circular dependency support via two-phase construction
- Correct is_public and is_eager semantics (private by default)

NOTE: This module does NOT include dynamic class generation.

    """
    Lazy evaluation wrapper for resources and scopes.

    Mixin is mutable (NOT frozen) to support two-phase construction
    for circular dependencies within the same Scope.

    All lazy evaluation happens ONLY at Mixin.evaluated level.
    Dynamically decides whether to evaluate to a resource value or Scope.

    .. note::

       Does NOT inherit from Node/Mixin - completely separate hierarchy.
       Inherits from HasDict to support @cached_property with slots=True.

    .. todo:: Dynamic slots for sibling dependencies

       Currently sibling dependencies are stored in ``HasDict.__dict__`` via setattr.
       For better performance, future implementation should use ``make_dataclass``
       to dynamically generate Mixin subclasses with slots for each dependency.

       Example future design::

           DynamicMixin = make_dataclass(
               "DynamicMixin",
               [("foo", Mixin), ("bar", Mixin)],  # sibling dependency slots
               bases=(Mixin,),
               slots=True,
           )

    .. todo:: Nephew-uncle dependency support

       Currently sibling dependencies only contains sibling-to-sibling dependencies
       within the same scope. Nephew-uncle dependencies (where a nested scope's resource
       depends on its parent's sibling, i.e., an "uncle") are NOT supported.

       This limitation exists because we want lazy compilation for nested scopes (nephews).
       If we were to include nephew-uncle dependencies, we would need to eagerly analyze
       all nested scopes at construction time, defeating laziness.

       Example of unsupported pattern::

           @scope
           class Outer:
               @local
               @resource
               def uncle() -> str:  # Uncle is @local
                   return "uncle_value"

               @scope
               class Inner:
                   @resource
                   def nephew(uncle: str) -> str:  # Nephew depends on uncle
                       return f"got_{uncle}"  # ERROR: uncle is @local, not accessible

       Future solution: Add a ``@friend`` decorator that marks a scope for Ahead-Of-Time
       analysis. When applied, the scope's nested resources would be analyzed at
       construction time, allowing nephew-uncle dependencies to be wired.
       This would enable nephews to access uncle's @local resources.

    - Proper is_eager semantics (eager resources evaluated immediately)
