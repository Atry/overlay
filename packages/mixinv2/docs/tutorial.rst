Getting Started with Decorators
================================

The examples below build a single web application step by step, introducing one
concept at a time. All code is runnable with the standard library only.


Step 1 — Define services
------------------------

Decorate a class with ``@scope`` to make it a DI container. Annotate each value with
``@resource`` and expose it with ``@public``. Resources declare their dependencies as
ordinary function parameters; the framework injects them by name.

Use ``@extern`` to declare a dependency that must come from outside the scope — the
equivalent of a pytest fixture parameter. Pass multiple scopes to ``evaluate()`` to
compose them; dependencies are resolved by name across scope boundaries. Config
values are passed as kwargs when calling the evaluated scope.

.. literalinclude:: ../../mixinv2-examples/src/mixinv2_examples/app_decorator/step1_services.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: # [docs:step1-define-services]
   :end-before: # [/docs:step1-define-services]
   :dedent:

``SQLiteDatabase`` owns ``database_path``; ``UserRepository`` has no knowledge of the
database layer — it only declares ``connection: sqlite3.Connection`` as a parameter
and receives it automatically from the composed scope.


Step 2 — Layer cross-cutting concerns with ``@patch`` and ``@merge``
--------------------------------------------------------------------

``@patch`` wraps an existing resource value with a transformation. This lets an
add-on scope modify a value without touching the scope that defined it — the same
idea as pytest's ``monkeypatch``, but composable.

.. literalinclude:: ../../mixinv2-examples/src/mixinv2_examples/app_decorator/step2_patch.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: # [docs:step2-patch]
   :end-before: # [/docs:step2-patch]
   :dedent:

When several independent scopes each contribute a piece to the same resource, use
``@merge`` to define how the contributions are aggregated:

.. literalinclude:: ../../mixinv2-examples/src/mixinv2_examples/app_decorator/step2_merge.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: # [docs:step2-merge]
   :end-before: # [/docs:step2-merge]
   :dedent:

A ``@patch`` can itself declare ``@extern`` dependencies, which are injected like any
other resource:

.. literalinclude:: ../../mixinv2-examples/src/mixinv2_examples/app_decorator/step2_patch_extern.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: # [docs:step2-patch-extern]
   :end-before: # [/docs:step2-patch-extern]
   :dedent:


Step 3 — Force evaluation at startup with ``@eager``
-----------------------------------------------------

All resources are lazy by default: computed on first access, then cached for the
lifetime of the scope. Mark a resource ``@eager`` to evaluate it immediately when
``evaluate()`` returns — useful for schema migrations or connection pre-warming that
must complete before the application starts serving requests:

.. literalinclude:: ../../mixinv2-examples/src/mixinv2_examples/app_decorator/step3_eager.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: # [docs:step3-eager]
   :end-before: # [/docs:step3-eager]
   :dedent:

Without ``@eager``, the ``CREATE TABLE`` would not run until ``root.connection`` is first
accessed.


Step 4 — App scope vs request scope
------------------------------------

So far all resources have had application lifetime: created once at startup and
reused for every request. Real applications also need per-request resources — values
that must be created fresh for each incoming request and discarded when it completes.

A nested ``@scope`` named ``RequestScope`` serves as a per-request factory. The
framework injects it by name as a ``Callable``; calling
``RequestScope(request=handler)`` returns a fresh instance.

The application below has four scopes, each owning only its own concern:

- **SQLiteDatabase** — owns ``database_path``, provides ``connection``
- **UserRepository** — business logic; owns ``user_count`` and per-request ``current_user``
- **HttpHandlers** — HTTP layer; owns per-request ``user_id``, ``response_body``, ``response_sent``
- **NetworkServer** — network layer; owns ``host``/``port``, creates the ``HTTPServer``

``UserRepository.RequestScope`` and ``HttpHandlers.RequestScope`` are composed into a
single ``RequestScope`` by the union mount. ``user_id`` (extracted from the HTTP path
by ``HttpHandlers.RequestScope``) flows automatically into ``current_user`` (looked up
in the DB by ``UserRepository.RequestScope``) without any glue code.

``response_sent`` is an IO resource: it sends the HTTP response as a side effect and
returns ``None``. The handler body is a single attribute access — all logic lives in
the DI graph. In an async framework (e.g. FastAPI), return an ``asyncio.Task[None]``
instead of a coroutine, which cannot be safely awaited in multiple dependents.

       @public
       @resource
       def connection(database_path: str) -> sqlite3.Connection:

       class RequestScope:

           def user_id() -> int: ...        # provided by HttpHandlers.RequestScope

           @public
           @resource
           def current_user(
               connection: sqlite3.Connection, user_id: int, User: Callable
           ) -> object:
               row = connection.execute(
                   "SELECT id, name FROM users WHERE id = ?", (user_id,)
               ).fetchone()
               assert row is not None, f"no user with id={user_id}"
               identifier, name = row
               return User(user_id=identifier, name=name)

           @public
           @resource
           def user_id(request: BaseHTTPRequestHandler) -> int:
               return int(request.path.split("/")[-1])

           # current_user and user_count resolved from their respective scopes.

               request.send_response(200)
               request.end_headers()
               request.wfile.write(response_body)

   @scope

       @extern
       def port() -> int: ...

       # RequestScope is injected by name as a Callable (StaticScope).
       # Calling RequestScope(request=handler) returns a fresh InstanceScope.
       @public
       @resource
       def server(host: str, port: int, RequestScope: Callable) -> HTTPServer:
           class Handler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
               def do_GET(self) -> None:
                   RequestScope(request=self).response_sent

           return HTTPServer((host, port), Handler)

   # Declare composition via @extend — each scope only knows its own config.
   @extend(
       LexicalReference(path=("SQLiteDatabase",)),
       LexicalReference(path=("UserRepository",)),
       LexicalReference(path=("HttpHandlers",)),
       LexicalReference(path=("NetworkServer",)),
   )
   @public
   @scope
   class app:
       pass

   # Assemble into a module and evaluate — composition is declared above, not here.
   myapp = ModuleType("myapp")
   myapp.SQLiteDatabase = SQLiteDatabase
   myapp.UserRepository = UserRepository
   myapp.HttpHandlers = HttpHandlers
   myapp.NetworkServer = NetworkServer
   myapp.app = app

   root = evaluate(myapp, modules_public=True).app(
       database_path="/var/lib/myapp/prod.db",
       host="127.0.0.1",
       port=8080,
   )
   server = root.server

Swapping to a test configuration is just different kwargs; no scope or composition changes:

.. code-block:: python

   test_root = evaluate(myapp, modules_public=True).app(
       database_path=":memory:",  # fresh, isolated database for each test
       host="127.0.0.1",
       port=0,                    # OS assigns a free port
   )
   # test_root.connection  → sqlite3.Connection to :memory:
   # test_root.server      → HTTPServer on OS-assigned port

Python modules as scopes
-------------------------

The ``@scope`` classes above are a teaching convenience — the real-world style is
plain Python modules, just like pytest fixtures don't require a class. Every
``@scope`` class maps directly to a module file; pass it to ``evaluate()`` the same
way:

.. code-block:: python

   import sqlite_database   # sqlite_database.py with @extern / @resource / @public
   import user_repository   # user_repository/ package

The same decorators work on module-level functions exactly as on class methods. A
subpackage becomes a nested scope — ``user_repository/request_scope/`` is the
module equivalent of a nested ``@scope class RequestScope``.

Use ``@extend`` in a package's ``__init__.py`` to declare the composition, then
``evaluate()`` receives the single package:

.. literalinclude:: ../../mixinv2-examples/src/mixinv2_examples/app_di/__init__.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: # [docs:module-extend]
   :end-before: # [/docs:module-extend]

.. code-block:: python

   import myapp

   root = evaluate(myapp, modules_public=True).app(database_path=":memory:")
