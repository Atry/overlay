mixinject: A dependency injection framework with pytest-fixture-like semantics.

Design Philosophy
=================

mixinject implements a dependency injection framework that combines pytest fixture-like semantics
with hierarchical resource structures and mixin composition patterns, inspired by
https://github.com/atry/mixin and https://github.com/mxmlnkn/ratarmount/pull/163.

Key Terminology
---------------

**Resource**
    A named injectable value defined via decorators like :func:`resource`, :func:`patch`,
    :func:`patch_many`, or :func:`merge`.

**Scope**
    An object that contains resources, accessed via attribute access (``.`` operator).
    Scopes can be nested to form hierarchical structures, analogous to a filesystem directory
    hierarchy. See :class:`Scope`.

**Lexical Scope**
    The lookup chain for resolving resources, scanning from inner to outer layers.
    See :data:`CapturedScopes`.

**Mixin**
    A value producer that participates in resource evaluation. There are three types:
    :class:`Merger` (creates values from patches), :class:`Patcher` (provides patches),
    and Semigroup (both Merger and Patcher). See :data:`Mixin`.

**Merger**
    A type of Mixin that creates a resource value by aggregating patches.
    See :class:`Merger`.

**Patcher**
    A type of Mixin that provides patches to be applied to a Merger's result.
    See :class:`Patcher`.

**Semigroup**
    A type of Mixin that is BOTH Merger AND Patcher simultaneously. This enables
    commutative composition where any item can serve as the merger while others
    contribute patches. Example: :func:`scope` creates a semigroup for nested
    Scope composition.

**Endofunction**
    A function of type ``Callable[[T], T]`` that transforms a value of type ``T`` into another
    value of the same type. This is a common patch type used with :func:`resource`. See :data:`Endofunction`.

Core Design Principle: Explicit Decorator Marking
==================================================

All injectable definitions **MUST** be explicitly marked with one of these decorators:

- :func:`resource`: Creates a merger that applies endo patches (``Callable[[T], T]``)
- :func:`patch`: Provides a single patch to an existing resource
- :func:`patch_many`: Provides multiple patches to an existing resource
- :func:`merge`: Creates a merger with custom aggregation strategy
- :func:`extern`: Declares a parameter placeholder (syntactic sugar for empty :func:`patch_many`)

Bare callables (functions without decorators) are **NOT** automatically injected.
This explicit-only design makes dependency injection predictable and self-documenting.

Example::

    from mixinject import resource, patch, mount

    # ✓ CORRECT: Explicitly decorated
    @resource
    def greeting() -> str:
        return "Hello"

    @patch
    def greeting() -> Callable[[str], str]:
        return lambda s: s + "!"

    # ✗ INCORRECT: Bare callable (will be ignored)
    def ignored_function() -> str:
        return "This won't be injected"

    root = mount(...)
    root.greeting  # "Hello!"
    root.ignored_function  # AttributeError: 'StaticScope' object has no attribute 'ignored_function'

Union Filesystem Analogy
========================

If we make an analogy to union filesystems:

- :class:`Scope` objects are like directory objects
- Resources are like files
- Modules, packages, callables, and :class:`ScopeDefinition` are filesystem definitions before mounting
- The compiled result (from :func:`mount`) is a concrete :class:`Scope` that implements resource access

Merger/Patcher Architecture
=============================

Resource Evaluation Algorithm
-----------------------------

When evaluating a resource, the system collects all Merger/Patcher items and applies
the following algorithm:

1. **Pure Merger** (Merger but NOT Patcher): If exactly one exists, it becomes the
   selected merger. All other items are treated as patches.

2. **Multiple Pure Mergers**: Raises ``ValueError`` (ambiguous which should be the base).

3. **No Pure Mergers, but Semigroups exist**: One semigroup is arbitrarily selected as
   the merger (assumes commutativity), and the rest are treated as patches.

4. **No Mergers at all**: Raises ``NotImplementedError`` (no way to create the resource).

+-------------------+----------+---------+------------------------------------------+

    Support phony targets for marking Semigroups that return ``None``.

    Similar to ``.PHONY`` targets in Makefiles, phony resources are primarily used
    to trigger side effects rather than produce values. This is useful for scenarios like:

    - Initialization operations (e.g., warming up database connection pools)
    - Resource cleanup (e.g., closing file handles)
    - Aggregation operations that trigger multiple dependencies

    Design considerations:

    1. **Declaration method**: Add ``@phony`` decorator to mark resource definitions returning ``None``::

           @phony
           def initialize_logging(config: Config) -> None:
               logging.basicConfig(level=config.log_level)

    2. **Type safety**: Phony resources should have type ``None`` and return ``None`` when accessed::

           root.initialize_logging  # Trigger side effect, returns None

    3. **Semigroup semantics**: When merging multiple phony definitions, all side effects are executed.
       **Important**: Users must ensure multiple phony definitions are commutative and do not depend on execution order::

           @phony
           def setup():
               register_handler_a()  # Must be independent from other setup side effects

           @phony
           def setup():
               register_handler_b()  # Must be independent from other setup side effects

    4. **Dependency tracking**: Phony resources can depend on other resources, ensuring dependencies are ready before side effects execute::

           @phony
           def warmup_cache(database: Database, cache: Cache) -> None:
               cache.populate_from(database)

    5. **Difference from ``@resource``**:

       - ``@resource`` return values are cached and can be depended on by other resources
       - ``@phony`` returns ``None``, primarily for triggering side effects, with multiple definitions merged as Semigroup

    6. **Decorator table update**:

       +-------------------+----------+---------+------------------------------------------+
       | @phony            | Yes      | Yes     | Semigroup for side-effect-only resources |
       +-------------------+----------+---------+------------------------------------------+

    Support specifying ``PurePath`` via type annotation to locate dependencies.

    Current dependency resolution is based on looking up parameter names in the symbol table,
    requiring traversal of closure levels. Using ``Annotated`` and ``PurePath`` allows explicit
    specification of relative paths for dependencies, avoiding symbol table lookups::

        # Desired syntax
        @resource
        def connection_pool(
            database_url: Annotated[URL, ResourceReference.from_pure_path(PurePath("../../config/database_url"))]
        ):
            return create_connection_pool(database_url)

        # Roughly equivalent to current syntax
        @resource
        def connection_pool(config: Scope):
            return create_connection_pool(config.database_url)

    The former explicitly specifies the location of ``database_url``, while the latter requires
    looking up the closure level where ``config`` is located in the symbol table.

    The advantage of ``ResourceReference`` is that it can access resources not in the lexical scope.
    Even if ``config`` is not in the current lexical scope's symbol table, ``../../config`` can still
    directly locate it through the path.

Combining Definitions
---------------------

Multiple definitions for the same resource name are combined using the algorithm above.
Common patterns:

**Resource + Patches** (most common)::

    @resource
    def value() -> int:
        return 10

    @patch
    def value() -> Callable[[int], int]:
        return lambda x: x * 2

    # Result: 20 (base value 10 transformed by patch)

**Merger + Patches** (custom aggregation)::

    @merge
    def tags() -> type[frozenset]:
        return frozenset

    @patch
    def tags() -> str:
        return "tag1"

    @patch
    def tags() -> str:
        return "tag2"

    # Result: frozenset({"tag1", "tag2"})

**Multiple Scopes** (semigroup composition)::

    @scope
    class Base:
        @resource
        def foo() -> str:
            return "base_foo"

    @scope
    class Extension:
        @resource
        def bar() -> str:
            return "ext_bar"

    # Result: Scope with both foo and bar resources (merged)

Dependency Resolution
=====================

Name-Based Resolution
---------------------

Dependency injection is **always based on parameter names**, not types. The parameter resolution
algorithm (similar to https://github.com/atry/mixin) automatically searches for dependencies
in the lexical scope chain (from inner to outer).

Simple Dependency Example::

    @resource
    def my_resource(some_dependency: str) -> float:
        return float(some_dependency)

The parameter ``some_dependency`` is resolved by searching the lexical scope chain for a resource
named ``some_dependency``.

Complex Path Access via Scope
------------------------------

To access resources via complex paths, you must use an explicit :class:`Scope` parameter::

    @resource
    def my_callable(uncle: Scope) -> float:
        return uncle.path.to.resource

This searches the lexical scope chain for the first :class:`Scope` that defines a resource
named ``uncle``, then accesses ``path.to.resource`` under that :class:`Scope`.

Scope-Returning Resources as Symbolic Links
--------------------------------------------

If a callable returns a :class:`Scope`, that resource acts like a symbolic link
(similar to https://github.com/mxmlnkn/ratarmount/pull/163)::

    @resource
    def my_scope(uncle: Scope) -> Scope:
        return uncle.path.to.another_scope

This finds the first :class:`Scope` in the lexical scope that defines ``uncle``, then accesses
nested resources through that :class:`Scope`.

Same-Name Dependency (Extending Outer Definitions)
---------------------------------------------------

When a parameter name matches the resource name, it skips the current :class:`Scope` and
looks for the same-named resource in outer scopes. This pattern allows extending or
transforming an outer scope's definition::

    class Outer:
        @resource
        def counter() -> int:
            return 0

        @scope
        class Inner:
            @resource
            def counter(counter: int) -> int:  # same-name parameter
                return counter + 1  # extends outer's counter

    root = mount(Outer)
    root.counter  # 0
    root.Inner.counter  # 1 (outer's 0 + 1)

**Comparison with @patch endo:**

Two patterns look similar but work differently:

1. **@resource with same-name parameter** (Merger, looks up from PARENT scope)::

       @resource
       def counter(counter: int) -> int:  # parameter resolved from outer
           return counter + 1

2. **@patch returning endo** (Patcher, endo receives base value from Merger)::

       @patch
       def counter() -> Callable[[int], int]:
           return lambda counter: counter + 1  # endo argument is base value

The key difference:

- ``@resource`` with same-name parameter creates a **new Merger** that shadows the
  outer definition. The parameter is resolved at compile-time from the outer scope's
  symbol table.
- ``@patch`` returning an endo creates a **Patcher** that transforms an existing
  Merger's result. The endo function's argument receives the base value at runtime.

Merging and Composition
========================

Module and Package Merging
---------------------------

When merging modules and packages, mixinject uses an algorithm similar to
https://github.com/atry/mixin and https://github.com/mxmlnkn/ratarmount/pull/163.

Same-Named Callable Merging Rules
----------------------------------

When merging N same-named definitions, the Merger/Patcher evaluation algorithm applies:

- At most **1** pure merger (:func:`resource` or :func:`merge`) is allowed
- Any number of pure patchers (:func:`patch`, :func:`patch_many`, :func:`extern`) are allowed
- Semigroups (:func:`scope`) can serve as either merger or patcher

Union Mounting at Entry Point
------------------------------

At the framework entry point (:func:`mount`), users can pass multiple packages, modules,
or objects, which are union-mounted into a unified root :class:`Scope`, similar to
https://github.com/mxmlnkn/ratarmount/pull/163.

Parameter Injection Pattern
============================

Concept
-------

A resource can be defined **solely** by :func:`patch`, :func:`patch_many`, or :func:`extern`
decorators, without a base definition from :func:`resource` or :func:`merge`. This is
the **parameter injection pattern** - a way to declare that a value should be provided from
an outer scope via :class:`InstanceScope` or :meth:`StaticScope.__call__`.

Two Equivalent Approaches
--------------------------

**Recommended: @extern decorator**::

    @extern
    def settings(): ...

**Alternative: @patch with identity endo**::

    @patch
    def settings() -> Callable[[dict], dict]:
        return lambda x: x  # identity function

Both approaches register the resource name in the symbol table and expect the base value
to be provided via :meth:`StaticScope.__call__`. The ``@extern`` decorator is syntactic sugar
that makes the intent clearer.

How It Works
------------

When a parameter-only resource is accessed:

1. The resource name is found in the symbol table (registered by ``@extern`` or ``@patch``)
2. The base value is looked up from :class:`InstanceScope` (created via ``StaticScope.__call__``)
3. All patches are applied (identity patches pass through unchanged)
4. The final value is returned

If no base value is provided, ``NotImplementedError`` is raised.

Example
-------

::

    # config.py
    from mixinject import parameter, resource

    @extern
    def settings(): ...

    @resource
    def connection_string(settings: dict) -> str:
        return f"{settings['host']}:{settings['port']}"

    # main.py
    from mixinject import mount

    root = mount(config)(settings={"host": "db.example.com", "port": "3306"})
    assert root.connection_string == "db.example.com:3306"

Use Cases
---------

This pattern is useful for:

- **Configuration parameters**: Modules declare they need configuration without defining values
- **Dependency injection**: Inject external dependencies without hardcoding
- **Multi-version support**: Combine the same module with different injected values

Scope as Callable
=================

Every :class:`Scope` object is also callable, supporting direct parameter injection.

Implementation
--------------

:class:`Scope` implements ``__call__(**kwargs)``, returning a new :class:`Scope` of the same type
creating an :class:`InstanceScope` that stores kwargs directly for lookup.

Example::

    # Create a Scope and inject values using mount
    @scope
    class Config:
        @extern
        def setting(): ...
        @extern
        def count(): ...

    scope = mount(Config)
    new_scope = scope(setting="value", count=42)

    # Access injected values
    assert new_scope.setting == "value"
    assert new_scope.count == 42

Primary Use Case
----------------

The primary use of Scope as Callable is to provide base values for parameter injection.
By using :meth:`Scope.__call__` in an outer scope to inject parameter values, resources in
modules can access these values via symbol table lookup::

    # Provide base value in outer scope via mount
    @scope
    class Config:
        @extern
        def db_config(): ...

    outer_scope = mount(Config)(db_config={"host": "localhost", "port": "5432"})

    outer_scope: CapturedScopes = (outer_scope,)

    # Resources in modules can obtain this value via same-named parameter
    @scope
    class Database:
        @extern
        def db_config(): ...

        @resource
        def connection(db_config: dict) -> str:
            return f"{db_config['host']}:{db_config['port']}"

Callables can be used not only to define resources but also to define and transform Scope objects.

    All symbols support the Mapping interface (``__getitem__``, ``__iter__``, ``__len__``).
    Scope symbols have nested resources (len > 0), while leaf symbols have no items (len = 0).

    Conceptual Layer Distinction
    ============================

    This system has two distinct layers that should not be conflated:

    **Symbol Layer (Dependency Graph Nodes)**

    - ``Symbol``: Base class (all symbols are Mappings)
    - ``NestedScopeSymbol``: Scope Symbol with nested resources (len > 0)
    - ``NestedScopeSymbol``: Nested Scope Symbol (IS-A Mapping)

    **Evaluator Layer (Resource Evaluators)**

    - ``Evaluator = Merger | Patcher``
    - ``Merger``: Merges patches to produce result
    - ``Patcher``: Provides patches
    - ``_NestedMappingMixin``: An Evaluator that implements both Merger and Patcher

    **Relationship**

    - ``NestedMergerSymbol.__call__`` returns ``Merger``
    - ``NestedPatcherSymbol.__call__`` returns ``Patcher``
    - ``NestedScopeSymbol.__call__`` returns ``_NestedMappingMixin`` (an Evaluator)

    ``_NestedMappingMixin`` is currently the only Semigroup Evaluator, but the system
    will support other Semigroups in the future. Semigroup is an Evaluator layer
    concept and should not be conflated with the Symbol layer.

    Refactoring Goals and Motivation
    ==================================

    Optimization Scenario
    ---------------------

    This refactoring aims to optimize **scenarios where massive Symbols are merged into a single Proxy after linearization**.

    **Definition of "massive"**: 100+ Symbols need to be merged.

    In complex dependency injection scenarios, a Scope may inherit from multiple base classes, each with its own
    inheritance chain. After linearization, looking up a single resource may require traversing 100+ Symbols. The
    current implementation traverses all Symbols at runtime and performs ``isinstance`` checks, which becomes a
    performance bottleneck in massive Symbol scenarios.

    Optimization Strategy
    ---------------------

    1. **Compile-time type classification**: When creating Symbol in ``ScopeSymbol.__getitem__``,
       determine whether it's Merger/Patcher/Mapping based on Symbol type
    2. **Precompute indices**: Store type classification results in ``merger_base_indices``,
       ``patcher_base_indices``, ``mapping_base_indices``
    3. **Random access instead of traversal**: Proxy/JIT uses precomputed indices to directly access
       needed Symbols, eliminating runtime traversal and ``isinstance`` checks

    Typed Symbol Hierarchy

    ``__call__`` Semantics
    ======================

    ``Symbol`` implements the ``EvaluatorGetter`` interface, i.e.::

        EvaluatorGetter: TypeAlias = Callable[[CapturedScopes], Evaluator]

    Calling ``symbol(captured_scopes)`` returns a ``Mixin`` (``Merger | Patcher``).
    Different subclasses have different return types:

    - ``NestedMergerSymbol.__call__`` → ``Merger`` (not Patcher)
    - ``NestedPatcherSymbol.__call__`` → ``Patcher`` (not Merger)
    - ``NestedScopeSymbol.__call__`` → ``_NestedMappingMixin`` (an Evaluator: Merger ∩ Patcher)

class NestedSymbolIndex:
    """
    Two-dimensional index of Symbol in outer ScopeSymbol, supporting O(1) random access.

    Basic Concept
    =============

    ``NestedSymbolIndex`` uses a two-dimensional index ``(primary_index, secondary_index)`` to locate
    a Symbol's position in its outer ScopeSymbol's linearized inheritance chain.

    - ``primary_index``: Identifies the source of the nested symbol

      - ``OuterBaseIndex``: Inherited from outer's linearized bases
      - ``OwnBaseIndex``: Explicitly extended via ``extend`` parameter

    - ``secondary_index``: Position within that source's linearized chain

      - ``int``: Position in the source's ``generate_strict_super()``
      - ``SymbolIndexSentinel.OWN``: The source itself (not one of its strict super symbols)

    Index Semantics
    ===============

    The integer indices in ``OuterBaseIndex`` and ``OwnBaseIndex`` are plain array subscripts
    with no special meaning. ``SymbolIndexSentinel.OWN`` is needed because a symbol does not
    appear in its own ``generate_strict_super()`` - only its strict super symbols do.

    Index Examples
    ==============

    Given ``nested_symbol: NestedScopeSymbol`` with ``key`` in ``outer: Symbol``,
    and integer indices ``i``, ``j``:

    - ``NestedSymbolIndex(primary_index=OuterBaseIndex(index=i), secondary_index=SymbolIndexSentinel.OWN)``::

        # outer_bases[i][key] itself
        outer_bases = tuple(outer.generate_strict_super())
        target = outer_bases[i][key]

    - ``NestedSymbolIndex(primary_index=OuterBaseIndex(index=i), secondary_index=j)``::

        # The j-th strict super symbol of outer_bases[i][key]
        outer_bases = tuple(outer.generate_strict_super())
        outer_nested = outer_bases[i][key]
        target = tuple(outer_nested.generate_strict_super())[j]

    - ``NestedSymbolIndex(primary_index=OwnBaseIndex(index=i), secondary_index=SymbolIndexSentinel.OWN)``::

        # extend_refs[i] itself
        extend_refs = nested_symbol.definition.bases
        target = _resolve_symbol_reference(extend_refs[i], outer, NestedScopeSymbol)

    - ``NestedSymbolIndex(primary_index=OwnBaseIndex(index=i), secondary_index=j)``::

        # The j-th strict super symbol of extend_refs[i]
        extend_refs = nested_symbol.definition.bases
        own_base = _resolve_symbol_reference(extend_refs[i], outer, NestedScopeSymbol)
        target = tuple(own_base.generate_strict_super())[j]

    JIT Optimization Use Cases
    ===========================

    This data structure is designed for JIT and Proxy optimization:

    1. **Eliminate runtime traversal**: JIT can directly access specific Symbols using indices,
       without traversing ``generate_strict_super()``

    2. **O(1) random access**: Given ``NestedSymbolIndex``, the Symbol's position can be directly
       computed with O(1) time complexity

    3. **Typed indices**: Combined with ``merger_base_indices``, ``patcher_base_indices``,
       ``mapping_base_indices``, JIT can directly access specific types of Symbols

    Collaboration with Typed Symbols
    ================================

    After refactoring, this index will be used for the following typed index properties:

    ::

        merger_base_indices: Mapping[NestedMergerSymbol, NestedSymbolIndex]
        patcher_base_indices: Mapping[NestedPatcherSymbol, NestedSymbolIndex]
        mapping_base_indices: Mapping[NestedScopeSymbol, NestedSymbolIndex]

    JIT Usage Example::

        # Directly access all Mergers without traversal and isinstance checks
        for merger, index in scope.symbol.merger_base_indices.items():
            mixin_result = merger(captured_scopes)  # Return type guaranteed to be Merger
