mixinject: A dependency injection framework with pytest-fixture-like semantics.

Design Philosophy
=================

mixinject implements a dependency injection framework that combines pytest fixture-like semantics
with hierarchical resource structures and mixin composition patterns, inspired by
https://github.com/atry/mixin and https://github.com/mxmlnkn/ratarmount/pull/163.

Key Terminology
---------------

**Resource**
    A named injectable value defined via decorators like :func:`resource`, :func:`patch`,
    :func:`patch_many`, or :func:`merge`.

**Scope**
    An object that contains resources, accessed via attribute access (``.`` operator).
    Scopes can be nested to form hierarchical structures, analogous to a filesystem directory
    hierarchy. See :class:`Scope`.

**Lexical Scope**
    The lookup chain for resolving resources, scanning from inner to outer layers.
    See :data:`CapturedScopes`.

**Mixin**
    A value producer that participates in resource evaluation. There are three types:
    :class:`Merger` (creates values from patches), :class:`Patcher` (provides patches),
    and Semigroup (both Merger and Patcher). See :data:`Mixin`.

**Merger**
    A type of Mixin that creates a resource value by aggregating patches.
    See :class:`Merger`.

**Patcher**
    A type of Mixin that provides patches to be applied to a Merger's result.
    See :class:`Patcher`.

**Semigroup**
    A type of Mixin that is BOTH Merger AND Patcher simultaneously. This enables
    commutative composition where any item can serve as the merger while others
    contribute patches. Example: :func:`scope` creates a semigroup for nested
    Scope composition.

**Endofunction**
    A function of type ``Callable[[T], T]`` that transforms a value of type ``T`` into another
    value of the same type. This is a common patch type used with :func:`resource`. See :data:`Endofunction`.

Core Design Principle: Explicit Decorator Marking
==================================================

All injectable definitions **MUST** be explicitly marked with one of these decorators:

- :func:`resource`: Creates a merger that applies endo patches (``Callable[[T], T]``)
- :func:`patch`: Provides a single patch to an existing resource
- :func:`patch_many`: Provides multiple patches to an existing resource
- :func:`merge`: Creates a merger with custom aggregation strategy
- :func:`extern`: Declares a parameter placeholder (syntactic sugar for empty :func:`patch_many`)

Bare callables (functions without decorators) are **NOT** automatically injected.
This explicit-only design makes dependency injection predictable and self-documenting.

Example::

    from mixinject import scope, resource, patch, evaluate

    @scope
    class Base:
        # ✓ CORRECT: Explicitly decorated
        @resource
        def greeting() -> str:
            return "Hello"

        # ✗ INCORRECT: Bare callable (will be ignored)
        def ignored_function() -> str:
            return "This won't be injected"

    @scope
    class Patches:
        @patch
        def greeting() -> Callable[[str], str]:
            return lambda s: s + "!"

    # Union mount: combine Base and Patches via evaluate()
    root = evaluate(Base, Patches)
    root.greeting  # "Hello!"
    root.ignored_function  # AttributeError: 'StaticScope' object has no attribute 'ignored_function'

Union Filesystem Analogy
========================

If we make an analogy to union filesystems:

- :class:`Scope` objects are like directory objects
- Resources are like files
- Modules, packages, callables, and :class:`ScopeDefinition` are filesystem definitions before evaluation
- The compiled result (from :func:`evaluate`) is a concrete :class:`Scope` that implements resource access

Merger/Patcher Architecture
=============================

Resource Evaluation Algorithm
-----------------------------

When evaluating a resource, the system collects all Merger/Patcher items and applies
the following algorithm:

1. **Pure Merger** (Merger but NOT Patcher): If exactly one exists, it becomes the
   selected merger. All other items are treated as patches.

2. **Multiple Pure Mergers**: Raises ``ValueError`` (ambiguous which should be the base).

3. **No Pure Mergers, but Semigroups exist**: One semigroup is arbitrarily selected as
   the merger (assumes commutativity), and the rest are treated as patches.

4. **No Mergers at all**: Raises ``NotImplementedError`` (no way to create the resource).

.. todo::
    Support phony targets for marking Semigroups that return ``None``.

    Similar to ``.PHONY`` targets in Makefiles, phony resources are primarily used
    to trigger side effects rather than produce values. This is useful for scenarios like:

    - Initialization operations (e.g., warming up database connection pools)
    - Resource cleanup (e.g., closing file handles)
    - Aggregation operations that trigger multiple dependencies

    Design considerations:

    1. **Declaration method**: Add ``@phony`` decorator to mark resource definitions returning ``None``::

           @phony
           def initialize_logging(config: Config) -> None:
               logging.basicConfig(level=config.log_level)

    2. **Type safety**: Phony resources should have type ``None`` and return ``None`` when accessed::

           root.initialize_logging  # Trigger side effect, returns None

    3. **Semigroup semantics**: When merging multiple phony definitions, all side effects are executed.
       **Important**: Users must ensure multiple phony definitions are commutative and do not depend on execution order::

           @scope
           class SetupA:
               @phony
               def setup():
                   register_handler_a()  # Must be independent from other setup side effects

           @scope
           class SetupB:
               @phony
               def setup():
                   register_handler_b()  # Must be independent from other setup side effects

           # Union mount combines both setup definitions
           root = evaluate(SetupA, SetupB)

    4. **Dependency tracking**: Phony resources can depend on other resources, ensuring dependencies are ready before side effects execute::

           @phony
           def warmup_cache(database: Database, cache: Cache) -> None:
               cache.populate_from(database)

    5. **Difference from ``@resource``**:

       - ``@resource`` return values are cached and can be depended on by other resources
       - ``@phony`` returns ``None``, primarily for triggering side effects, with multiple definitions merged as Semigroup

    6. **Decorator table update**:

       +-------------------+----------+---------+------------------------------------------+
       | @phony            | Yes      | Yes     | Semigroup for side-effect-only resources |
       +-------------------+----------+---------+------------------------------------------+

.. todo::
    Support specifying ``PurePath`` via type annotation to locate dependencies.

    Current dependency resolution is based on looking up parameter names in the symbol table,
    requiring traversal of closure levels. Using ``Annotated`` and ``PurePath`` allows explicit
    specification of relative paths for dependencies, avoiding symbol table lookups::

        # Desired syntax
        @resource
        def connection_pool(
            database_url: Annotated[URL, ResourceReference.from_pure_path(PurePath("../../config/database_url"))]
        ):
            return create_connection_pool(database_url)

        # Roughly equivalent to current syntax
        @resource
        def connection_pool(config: Scope):
            return create_connection_pool(config.database_url)

    The former explicitly specifies the location of ``database_url``, while the latter requires
    looking up the closure level where ``config`` is located in the symbol table.

    The advantage of ``ResourceReference`` is that it can access resources not in the lexical scope.
    Even if ``config`` is not in the current lexical scope's symbol table, ``../../config`` can still
    directly locate it through the path.

Combining Definitions
---------------------

Multiple definitions for the same resource name are combined using the algorithm above.
To combine definitions, use separate scopes and ``evaluate()`` for union mounting.
Common patterns:

**Resource + Patches** (most common)::

    @scope
    class Base:
        @resource
        def value() -> int:
            return 10

    @scope
    class Patches:
        @patch
        def value() -> Callable[[int], int]:
            return lambda x: x * 2

    root = evaluate(Base, Patches)
    root.value  # 20 (base value 10 transformed by patch)

**Merger + Patches** (custom aggregation)::

    @scope
    class MergerScope:
        @merge
        def tags() -> type[frozenset]:
            return frozenset

    @scope
    class Patch1:
        @patch
        def tags() -> str:
            return "tag1"

    @scope
    class Patch2:
        @patch
        def tags() -> str:
            return "tag2"

    root = evaluate(MergerScope, Patch1, Patch2)
    root.tags  # frozenset({"tag1", "tag2"})

**Multiple Scopes** (different resources)::

    @scope
    class Base:
        @resource
        def foo() -> str:
            return "base_foo"

    @scope
    class Extension:
        @resource
        def bar() -> str:
            return "ext_bar"

    root = evaluate(Base, Extension)
    # root has both foo and bar resources

Dependency Resolution
=====================

Name-Based Resolution
---------------------

Dependency injection is **always based on parameter names**, not types. The parameter resolution
algorithm (similar to https://github.com/atry/mixin) automatically searches for dependencies
in the lexical scope chain (from inner to outer).

Simple Dependency Example::

    @resource
    def my_resource(some_dependency: str) -> float:
        return float(some_dependency)

The parameter ``some_dependency`` is resolved by searching the lexical scope chain for a resource
named ``some_dependency``.

Complex Path Access via Scope
------------------------------

To access resources via complex paths, you must use an explicit :class:`Scope` parameter::

    @resource
    def my_callable(uncle: Scope) -> float:
        return uncle.path.to.resource

This searches the lexical scope chain for the first :class:`Scope` that defines a resource
named ``uncle``, then accesses ``path.to.resource`` under that :class:`Scope`.

Scope-Returning Resources as Symbolic Links
--------------------------------------------

If a callable returns a :class:`Scope`, that resource acts like a symbolic link
(similar to https://github.com/mxmlnkn/ratarmount/pull/163)::

    @resource
    def my_scope(uncle: Scope) -> Scope:
        return uncle.path.to.another_scope

This finds the first :class:`Scope` in the lexical scope that defines ``uncle``, then accesses
nested resources through that :class:`Scope`.

Same-Name Dependency (Extending Outer Definitions)
---------------------------------------------------

When a parameter name matches the resource name, it skips the current :class:`Scope` and
looks for the same-named resource in outer scopes. This pattern allows extending or
transforming an outer scope's definition::

    class Outer:
        @resource
        def counter() -> int:
            return 0

        @scope
        class Inner:
            @resource
            def counter(counter: int) -> int:  # same-name parameter
                return counter + 1  # extends outer's counter

    root = evaluate(Outer)
    root.counter  # 0
    root.Inner.counter  # 1 (outer's 0 + 1)

**Comparison with @patch endo:**

Two patterns look similar but work differently:

1. **@resource with same-name parameter** (Merger, looks up from PARENT scope)::

       @resource
       def counter(counter: int) -> int:  # parameter resolved from outer
           return counter + 1

2. **@patch returning endo** (Patcher, endo receives base value from Merger)::

       @patch
       def counter() -> Callable[[int], int]:
           return lambda counter: counter + 1  # endo argument is base value

The key difference:

- ``@resource`` with same-name parameter creates a **new Merger** that shadows the
  outer definition. The parameter is resolved at compile-time from the outer scope's
  symbol table.
- ``@patch`` returning an endo creates a **Patcher** that transforms an existing
  Merger's result. The endo function's argument receives the base value at runtime.

Merging and Composition
========================

Module and Package Merging
---------------------------

When merging modules and packages, mixinject uses an algorithm similar to
https://github.com/atry/mixin and https://github.com/mxmlnkn/ratarmount/pull/163.

Same-Named Callable Merging Rules
----------------------------------

When merging N same-named definitions, the Merger/Patcher evaluation algorithm applies:

- At most **1** pure merger (:func:`resource` or :func:`merge`) is allowed
- Any number of pure patchers (:func:`patch`, :func:`patch_many`, :func:`extern`) are allowed
- Semigroups (:func:`scope`) can serve as either merger or patcher

Union Mounting at Entry Point
------------------------------

At the framework entry point (:func:`evaluate`), users can pass a package, module,
or object, which is evaluated into a root :class:`Scope`, similar to
https://github.com/mxmlnkn/ratarmount/pull/163.

Parameter Injection Pattern
============================

Concept
-------

A resource can be defined **solely** by :func:`patch`, :func:`patch_many`, or :func:`extern`
decorators, without a base definition from :func:`resource` or :func:`merge`. This is
the **parameter injection pattern** - a way to declare that a value should be provided from
an outer scope via :class:`InstanceScope` or :meth:`StaticScope.__call__`.

Two Equivalent Approaches
--------------------------

**Recommended: @extern decorator**::

    @extern
    def settings(): ...

**Alternative: @patch with identity endo**::

    @patch
    def settings() -> Callable[[dict], dict]:
        return lambda x: x  # identity function

Both approaches register the resource name in the symbol table and expect the base value
to be provided via :meth:`StaticScope.__call__`. The ``@extern`` decorator is syntactic sugar
that makes the intent clearer.

How It Works
------------

When a parameter-only resource is accessed:

1. The resource name is found in the symbol table (registered by ``@extern`` or ``@patch``)
2. The base value is looked up from :class:`InstanceScope` (created via ``StaticScope.__call__``)
3. All patches are applied (identity patches pass through unchanged)
4. The final value is returned

If no base value is provided, ``NotImplementedError`` is raised.

Example
-------

::

    # config.py
    from mixinject import parameter, resource

    @extern
    def settings(): ...

    @resource
    def connection_string(settings: dict) -> str:
        return f"{settings['host']}:{settings['port']}"

    # main.py
    from mixinject import evaluate

    root = evaluate(config)(settings={"host": "db.example.com", "port": "3306"})
    assert root.connection_string == "db.example.com:3306"

Use Cases
---------

This pattern is useful for:

- **Configuration parameters**: Modules declare they need configuration without defining values
- **Dependency injection**: Inject external dependencies without hardcoding
- **Multi-version support**: Combine the same module with different injected values

Scope as Callable
=================

Every :class:`Scope` object is also callable, supporting direct parameter injection.

Implementation
--------------

:class:`Scope` implements ``__call__(**kwargs)``, returning a new :class:`Scope` of the same type
creating an :class:`InstanceScope` that stores kwargs directly for lookup.

Example::

    # Create a Scope and inject values using evaluate
    @scope
    class Config:
        @extern
        def setting(): ...
        @extern
        def count(): ...

    scope = evaluate(Config)
    new_scope = scope(setting="value", count=42)

    # Access injected values
    assert new_scope.setting == "value"
    assert new_scope.count == 42

Primary Use Case
----------------

The primary use of Scope as Callable is to provide base values for parameter injection.
By using :meth:`Scope.__call__` in an outer scope to inject parameter values, resources in
modules can access these values via symbol table lookup::

    # Provide base value in outer scope via evaluate
    @scope
    class Config:
        @extern
        def db_config(): ...

    outer_scope = evaluate(Config)(db_config={"host": "localhost", "port": "5432"})

    outer_scope: CapturedScopes = (outer_scope,)

    # Resources in modules can obtain this value via same-named parameter
    @scope
    class Database:
        @extern
        def db_config(): ...

        @resource
        def connection(db_config: dict) -> str:
            return f"{db_config['host']}:{db_config['port']}"

Callables can be used not only to define resources but also to define and transform Scope objects.

    .. todo:: Mixin and Scope Redesign

       Implement a new ``Mixin`` and ``Scope`` design to properly support
       ``is_local`` and ``is_eager`` semantics.

       **Mixin (Lazy Evaluation Layer)**

       - ``Mixin`` can be lazily evaluated to produce either a ``Resource`` or a ``Scope``
       - ``Mixin`` may be a dynamically generated class
       - ``Mixin`` is NOT frozen (mutable)
       - All lazy evaluation occurs at the ``Mixin.evaluated`` level

       **Scope (Frozen Data Container)**

       - ``Scope`` is a frozen, dynamically generated dataclass
       - ``Scope`` does NOT inherit from ``Mixin``
       - ``Scope`` has NO lazy evaluation capability at the attribute level
       - All attributes are eagerly resolved when the ``Scope`` instance is created

       **Circular Dependencies Between Mixin Instances**

       ``Mixin`` instances under the same ``Scope`` can have circular dependencies.
       This is achieved through a two-phase construction:

       1. First, construct all ``Mixin`` instances without arguments (empty initialization)
       2. Then, mutually set references by assigning each ``Mixin`` instance to the
          appropriate attributes of the others

       This pattern requires ``Mixin`` to be mutable (not frozen), enabling the deferred
       wiring of circular references after initial construction.

       **Key Difference from Current Design**

       The current ``Scope`` implements lazy evaluation at the attribute level (each field
       is lazily evaluated via descriptors). This duplicates the lazy evaluation already
       provided by ``Mixin``'s single-value lazy evaluation, resulting in redundant and
       inelegant design.

       In the new design:

       - Lazy evaluation happens ONLY at the ``Mixin.evaluated`` boundary
       - ``Scope`` attributes are NOT lazily evaluated
       - This eliminates the redundancy and provides a cleaner separation of concerns

    Two-dimensional index of MixinSymbol in outer MixinSymbol, supporting O(1) random access.

    Basic Concept
    =============

    ``NestedSymbolIndex`` uses a two-dimensional index ``(primary_index, secondary_index)`` to locate
    a MixinSymbol's position in its outer MixinSymbol's linearized inheritance chain.

    - ``primary_index``: Identifies the source of the nested symbol

      - ``OuterBaseIndex``: Inherited from outer's linearized bases
      - ``OwnBaseIndex``: Explicitly extended via ``extend`` parameter

    - ``secondary_index``: Position within that source's linearized chain

      - ``int``: Position in the source's ``generate_strict_super()``
      - ``SymbolIndexSentinel.OWN``: The source itself (not one of its strict super symbols)

    Index Semantics
    ===============

    The integer indices in ``OuterBaseIndex`` and ``OwnBaseIndex`` are plain array subscripts
    with no special meaning. ``SymbolIndexSentinel.OWN`` is needed because a symbol does not
    appear in its own ``generate_strict_super()`` - only its strict super symbols do.

    Index Examples
    ==============

    Given ``nested_symbol: MixinSymbol`` with ``key`` in ``outer: MixinSymbol``,
    and integer indices ``i``, ``j``:

    - ``NestedSymbolIndex(primary_index=OuterBaseIndex(index=i), secondary_index=SymbolIndexSentinel.OWN)``::

        # outer_bases[i][key] itself
        outer_bases = tuple(outer.generate_strict_super())
        target = outer_bases[i][key]

    - ``NestedSymbolIndex(primary_index=OuterBaseIndex(index=i), secondary_index=j)``::

        # The j-th strict super symbol of outer_bases[i][key]
        outer_bases = tuple(outer.generate_strict_super())
        outer_nested = outer_bases[i][key]
        target = tuple(outer_nested.generate_strict_super())[j]

    - ``NestedSymbolIndex(primary_index=OwnBaseIndex(index=i), secondary_index=SymbolIndexSentinel.OWN)``::

        # extend_refs[i] itself
        extend_refs = nested_symbol.definition.bases
        target = _resolve_symbol_reference(extend_refs[i], outer, MixinSymbol)

    - ``NestedSymbolIndex(primary_index=OwnBaseIndex(index=i), secondary_index=j)``::

        # The j-th strict super symbol of extend_refs[i]
        extend_refs = nested_symbol.definition.bases
        own_base = _resolve_symbol_reference(extend_refs[i], outer, MixinSymbol)
        target = tuple(own_base.generate_strict_super())[j]

    JIT Optimization Use Cases
    ===========================

    This data structure is designed for JIT and Proxy optimization:

    1. **Eliminate runtime traversal**: JIT can directly access specific Symbols using indices,
       without traversing ``generate_strict_super()``

    2. **O(1) random access**: Given ``NestedSymbolIndex``, the MixinSymbol's position can be directly
       computed with O(1) time complexity

    3. **Typed indices**: Combined with ``merger_base_indices``, ``patcher_base_indices``,
       ``scope_base_indices``, JIT can directly access specific types of Symbols

    Collaboration with Typed Symbols
    ================================

    After refactoring, this index will be used for the following typed index properties:

    ::

        merger_base_indices: Mapping[MergerSymbol, NestedSymbolIndex]
        patcher_base_indices: Mapping[PatcherSymbol, NestedSymbolIndex]
        scope_base_indices: Mapping[MixinSymbol, NestedSymbolIndex]

    JIT Usage Example::

        # Directly access all Mergers without traversal and isinstance checks
        for merger, index in scope.symbol.merger_base_indices.items():
            evaluator = merger.bind(mixin)  # Return type guaranteed to be Merger

    1. Is path[0] BOTH a property AND the scope's key? → raise ValueError (ambiguous)
    2. Is path[0] a property of that level? → early binding, return full path
    3. Is path[0] == that level's key? → self-reference, return path[1:]
    4. Recurse to outer

    Note: If a scope has a property with the same name as its key, this is ambiguous
    and raises ValueError. This strict behavior preserves future compatibility.
