"""Test circular references with lazy evaluation.

This test demonstrates that with lazy evaluation, MIXIN can support circular
references while remaining total. Each finite access terminates, even though
the conceptual structure is infinite.

This is similar to Haskell's "tying the knot" technique or Coq's coinductive types.
